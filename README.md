## Description

I decided to develop this project to practice my skills one more time. Practice makes
perfect as they say.

### What do I like about this project? ðŸ”¥
* It has a good-looking design
* I had an opportunity to design it in Figma (here comes the link https://www.figma.com/file/ln761zF8iavqNvK7oWZSay/To-Do-List?node-id=3%3A4)
* I added some cool features which I've never done before. They are dynamic gradient progress
  bar, gradient borders, and lots of great animations
* I used Redux for this app and learned its basics
* My ToDo List uses the localStorage to store user's data so there is no need for a server and database
* I experimented with a select element and added a custom arrow for it so it matches an app's design
* App counts the statistics

### What I don't like about this project?ðŸŒ§
* The design of the app is not adaptive
* The categories for ToDo are static and changes in the code
* The localStorage has a limited size and can be exceeded
* It was my first time using Redux and I think I could make some mistakes

You are good to go
